    <p> Jovana Đoković, born in 1999 in Kraljevo, is an emerging photographer who recently graduated at the Academy of
        Arts in Novi Sad. Her artistic journey began at the Art School in Kraljevo, where she cultivated her skills and
        passion for visual art.
        <br>
        <br>
        She has participated in ten group exhibitions, among which the following stand out:
        <br>
        <br>- Annual Exhibition of Young Visual Artists of Raška District, Cultural Center Ribnica, Kraljevo, 2017-2018
        <br>- Big FSU Contest for High School Creative Students, Dorćol Platz, Belgrade, 2018
        <br>- World Biennale of Student Photography, SKCNS Fabrika, Novi Sad, 2021
        <br>- World Biennale of Student Photography, exhibition space of the Academy of Arts, Novi Sad, 2023
        <br>
        <br>Jovana also had her first solo exhibition titled “Anemoia” at the Thrill Bar Gallery in Kraljevo in 2022.
        <br>
        <br>Her photographic style is deeply rooted in the exploration of human emotions, creating an immersive
        experience that invites viewers to engage on a sensory level. Her use of intentional blur in certain images
        serves to
        amplify the emotional resonance, encouraging a more profound connection rather than mere observation. By
        prioritizing
        feelings over technical precision, Jovana aims to evoke a sense of empathy and introspection, prompting viewers
        to not only see but also feel the stories behind her photographs. This approach transforms each image into a
        dynamic
        dialogue, where the viewer is invited to reflect on their own emotions and experiences in response to her work.
        <br>
        <br>Alongside her artistic pursuits, Jovana is the official photographer for Club Drop and Lollipop parties ,
        which
        enhances her experience in the visual arts.
