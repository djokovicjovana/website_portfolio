    <h1> Terminology of feelings </h1>
    <p>In this project, I explore the rich landscape of human emotions by uncovering new words for feelings we have all
        experienced but often struggled to name. This visual dictionary features 15 carefully chosen terms which are
        probably
        the most common.
        <br>
        <br> Presented in the form of a nostalgic and engaging book, this work invites you to relive these emotions,
        creating a space
        for reflection and connection. Each page serves as a portal to both familiar and uncharted feelings, allowing us
        to
        articulate our experiences in ways we may not have considered before.
        <br>
        <br> I believe that emotions—whether positive or negative—are the driving force behind our existence. They
        remind us of our
        humanity and the vibrant tapestry of life that surrounds us. By giving voice to these feelings, this project
        aims to
        foster a deeper understanding of ourselves and each other, celebrating the complexity of our emotional
        experiences as we
        navigate the journey of life.
