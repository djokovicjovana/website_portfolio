        This body of work is inspired by the harrowing journey of a young woman whose life was forever altered by a
        devastating
        experience with food poisoning. What began as a physical ailment spiraled into a prolonged struggle, marked by
        the
        consequences of medical ignorance. Misdiagnosed and subjected to unnecessary surgery, she faced two years of
        hardship
        and adaptation as she learned to navigate life with a stoma.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through this project, I aim to illuminate the profound impact of her suffering and resilience. Her story
        highlights the
        often-overlooked realities of medical misstepsâ€”how they can disrupt not just physical health, but also emotional
        well-being and identity. The emotional weight of her experience serves as a poignant reminder of the critical
        importance
        of compassion and diligence in healthcare.
        <br>
        <br>
        Using black and white analog photography, I seek to convey the complexities of her life during this challenging
        time.
        Each piece reflects the tension between hope and despair, capturing the daily battles she faced and the strength
        it took
        to reclaim her life.
        <br>
        <br>
        This work is not only a tribute to her resilience but also a call to recognize the human stories behind medical
        conditions. It invites viewers to reflect on the themes of suffering, adaptability, and the power of personal
        narrative.
        By sharing her experience, I hope to foster empathy and understanding for those who endure similar battles,
        emphasizing
        the importance of listening and advocating for one another in times of vulnerability.
