    <h1> Anemoia </h1>
    <p>Growing up, I was immersed in the world of dance—each class, each performance igniting a passion that seemed
        boundless.
        I envisioned a future as a professional dancer, a path that felt as vibrant and fluid as the movements I
        practiced.
        However, as life unfolded, circumstances led me away from this dream. Anemoia embodies this longing for what
        could have
        been, a wistful yearning for a past I can almost touch but never truly live.
        <br>
        <br>
        The video aspect of Anemoia draws inspiration from the image of ballerinas in boxes—delicate, confined, yet
        beautifully
        expressive. I resonate with this metaphor, feeling like one of those dancers, beautifully poised yet constrained
        by the
        realities of my life possibilities. Through my movements, I explore the tension between aspiration and
        limitation,
        capturing the essence of that childhood innocence alongside a sense of longing.
        <br>

        Anemoia is more than just a personal narrative; it’s a celebration of the dreams we hold dear, the paths we
        traverse,
        and the memories we cherish. It invites us to consider how the echoes of our past shape our present, and to find
        beauty
        in the stories we carry within us.
